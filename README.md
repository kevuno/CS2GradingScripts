# CS2GradingScripts

My Grading Scripts for CS2 at RIT.

They do the following:

- Testing

1. Copy files to the testing directory.
2. Compile classes inside the testing directory and run program with given arguements.
3. Save output of the compile and run into a file.
4. Display each line of the run output.
5. For next student, the copy will overwrite the files. 
6. Compare output differences using the diff python file.
